# Updating canton.io

## Context

The website canton.io is up at https://www.canton.io/.
Roger Bayston (Franklin Templeton EVP for Digital Asset, reporting to FT CEO) found it by googling "canton blockchain". He sent it to his FT engineering lead.

However https://canton.io/ redirects to https://www.digitalasset.com/developers. I think because we wanted to take the site down in March.

Given that FT is actively looking at canton.io and that we will be launching a separate, non DA site for Canton Network in 2022, I'd like to stop redirecting https://canton.io/ to the DA dev portal and keep https://www.canton.io/ up.

## Summary of call with Craig and Liz

Craig:
- no overall objection from Craig
- need review of page content => nominate Chris Olson (would like to see if can have proper tracking)
- will have to wait for next year

- need consistency with docs.daml.com

Brad:

- gate white paper behind form
